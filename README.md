# Inshare-Extended

This is an extended version of [inShare webapp](http://inshare.herokuapp.com/) (cuz why not?) which was created by [@Coder's Gyan](https://github.com/codersgyan) and [@ShivamJoker](https://github.com/ShivamJoker). Inshare-Extended is my addition to the original inShare app with additional, but important features like user authentication and much more. 

Links to the repos of the OG projects are:
* [Frontend](https://github.com/ShivamJoker/InShare)
* [Backend](https://github.com/codersgyan/inshare-file-sharing-app-api)

This extended version of [inShare](http://inshare.herokuapp.com/) have additional features like:
* - [x] Register/Login 
* - [x] A dashboard
* - [x] File Deletion Option
* - [x] Forgot Password 
* - [x] History table of the files 
* - [x] Google OAuth 

### Note: This project is still being built, I will put the working link as soon as I complete it :)
