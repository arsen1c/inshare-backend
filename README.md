# Inshare-Extended

This is an extended and a little revamped version of [inShare webapp](http://inshare.herokuapp.com/) (cuz why not?) which was created by [@Coder's Gyan](https://github.com/codersgyan) and [@ShivamJoker](https://github.com/ShivamJoker). Inshare-Extended is my addition to the original inShare app with additional, but important features like user authentication and much more.

* [Backend](https://github.com/codersgyan/inshare-file-sharing-app-api)

* - [x] Register/Login 
* - [x] A dashboard
* - [x] File Deletion Option
* - [x] Forgot Password
